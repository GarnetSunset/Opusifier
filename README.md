## What's the point?
Opus can deliver MP3 quality at a tenth of the size. You save a ton of space in the long run.

### Directory Selection
Either put music in the "music" folder in script root, or create a file called "directory.ini" containing the directory.

## Requirements Install

Python Requirements can be grabbed by either running the requirements file for your platform, or, typing

pip install -r Requirements.txt

#### Download FFMPEG Manually
https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/

Extract to the directory of the script.
